## Problem Statement

**AtliQo**, one of India’s leading telecom companies, launched its **5G services** in **May 2022** alongside its competitors. However, the management observed an unexpected decline in two critical KPIs:

* **Active users**
* **Revenue growth**

This raised major concerns, especially with their expansion plans in mind. The **business director** asked the analytics team to do a **comparative analysis of KPIs before and after the 5G launch**. The key goals were:

* To identify performance dips post-launch
* To explore **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)** changes
* To uncover **user churn patterns**
* And to provide insights on how **plan optimization** might bring users back

**Peter Pandey**, a junior data analyst, was assigned to take the lead on this task.
